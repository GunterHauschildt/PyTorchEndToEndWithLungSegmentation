Getting started in PyTorch (or Tensorflow) can be challenging: often Torch or Tensorflow's examples
start with with an internal dataset.

This example uses the Luna16 dataset, uses custom code to import it to a Torch dataset and trains.

This example also explores MonAI to generate a UNet mode (but includes a PyTorch coded UNet as well).
